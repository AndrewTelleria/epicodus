    <p>Hello friend,
 I am Andrew K. Telleria and I am a software developer. To give you a little background on myself I am
a Oregon native and I grew up in Salem, Oregon. I am a big fan of the outdoors and really enjoy 
going out in the middle of no where - it gives me perspective on issues I think are unique to me 
when they are not. I have just picked up a new hobby - wood working.</p>
<p>I started programming Janurary 2016 at Epicodus in Portland, Oregon. It was a coding bootcamp that 
lasted until the end of May of 2016 and it was forty hours a week. It really did immerse me into the 
world of programming. After I graduated from Epicodus I still did not feel job ready and some concepts
still did not sink in all the way.</p>
<p>Being that I did not feel ready I picked up a job for the time being at a restaurant and started to 
teach myself Python. Ever since I started learning Python all the concepts from Epicodus started to 
make sense. I would say this was my "Ah-ha!" moment. I completed the Treehouse courses on Python basics and the intro to Flask course. Once I felt confident enough I went through the <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Flask Mega Tutorial</a> and built a blog from the ground, up. Here is my <a href="https://github.com/AndrewTelleria/microblog">gitHub repo</a> with the blog.</p>
<p>Now I am enrolled into Hack Oregon Python II course. I am going to write posts on what we are 
learning to document for myself and whoever is interested in the same topics.</p>
<p>Andrew</p>
